# **Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau**

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of a website’s newsfeed feature to optimize user engagement. By leveraging Tableau, I have analyzed user interaction patterns with the 365 platform’s Newsfeed service from January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023. 

## **Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Create a Tableau dashboard that captures critical findings about user interactions with the newsfeed.
- Analyze the engagement patterns between automated and manual posts.
- Provide recommendations for refining the newsfeed feature based on data-driven insights.

## **Project Files**

To build the required visualizations, you will need the following file:
- **newsfeed_analysis.twbx**: Contains the necessary CSV files for creating the graphs in Tableau.

## **Requirements**

- Tableau Public 2023.1 or newer.

## **Contributing**

4. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - If you created a new branch, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab in your forked repository and click "New pull request." Compare your branch with the `main` branch of the original repository and submit the pull request for review.
